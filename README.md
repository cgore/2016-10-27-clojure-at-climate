# Clojure at Climate

This was a talk I gave at
[FullStack/STL](http://www.meetup.com/FullStack-STL/)
on Thursday, October 27, AD 2016.

Can you use Lisp in production? You can if it's Clojure! Much of the essential
business logic at The Climate Corporation is written in Clojure and running on
hundreds of machines.  Chris Gore, Senior Software Engineer, will talk about how
to get a basic Clojure app running and why you might want to write your
mission-critical code in Clojure.
